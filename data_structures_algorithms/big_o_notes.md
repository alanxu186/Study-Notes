### Big O Time Complexity

Analyzing the run time it takes to complete our task as the input size increases

- O(n): 
    - linear run time, directly proportional to input size n
- O(1): 
    - constant time, will always take the same time regardless of input size n 
- O(n^2):
    - quadratic time complexity, nested iterations/nested for loops
- O(log n):
    - logarithmic time complexity, 
    - Ex) binary search, binary search tree
